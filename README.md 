# 🌿 Smart Irrigation System using ESP32 + Blynk + ThingSpeak

An IoT-based smart irrigation system that monitors soil moisture, air quality, temperature, and humidity using ESP32 and DHT11 sensor, while controlling a servo-based water valve. Data is visualized via Blynk app and ThingSpeak cloud platform.
